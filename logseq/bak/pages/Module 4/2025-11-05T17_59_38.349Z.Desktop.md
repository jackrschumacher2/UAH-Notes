			- Funny not very serious but the story begins with the context of the plague

			  "either because of the influence of heavenly bodies or because of God's just
			  wrath as a punishment to mortals for our wicked deeds..
			  (3)
			  "bleeding from the nose was a manifest sign of inevitable death, but it began in
			  both men and women with certain swellings either in the groin or under the
			  armpits, some of which grew to the size of a normal apple and others to the
			  size of an egg, and the people called them gavoccioli" (4).

			- Some may interpret the plague as a sign from god
			- Shut the sick people in their houses
			- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
			  "they completely avoided the sick and their possessions...
			  (5)
			  "They shut themselves up in those houses where there were no sick people
			  (5)
			  "they believed that drinking too much, enjoying life, going about singing and
			  celebrating, satisfying in every way the appetites as best one could, laughing,
			  and making light of everything that happened was the best medicine" (5)

			  "for everyone felt he was doomed to die and, as a result, abandoned his property, and
			  any stranger who came upon them used them as if he were the rightful owner" (5)
			  "And in this great affliction and misery of our city the revered authority of the laws, both
			  divine and human, had fallen and almost completely disappeared" (5)
			  "This disaster had struck such fear into the hearts of men and women that brother
			  abandoned brother, uncle abandoned nephew, sister left brother, and very often wife
			  abandoned husband, and--even worse, almost unbelievable--fathers and mothers
			  neglected to tend and care for their children, as if they were not their own" (6)
			  #+END_QUOTE
				- Property was abandoned and people who came across the property were able to take possession of it
			- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
			  "not only did people die without having
			  a number of women around them, but
			  there were many who passed away
			  without even having a single witness
			  present.. ..Very few were the dead
			  whose bodies were accompanied to the
			  church by more than ten or twelve of
			  their neighbors, and these dead bodies
			  were not even carried on the shoulders
			  of honored and reputable citizens...
			  #+END_QUOTE
				- Many passed without having people around them
				- Mass leveling- the plague does not discriminate in who it affects
