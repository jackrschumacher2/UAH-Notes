- ### Merchandise Inventory Systems

- Two inventory accounting systems
	- **Periodic inventory system** requires a physical count of inventory to determine inventory on hand
	- **Perpetual inventory system** keeps a running computerized record of inventory
- #### Recording Perpetual inventory purchases
- Cycle begins with purchase of merchandise inventory
- Invoice is the seller's request for payment from purchaser
	- Also known as bills
	- Sellers have sales invoices
	- Purchasers have purchase invoices

- ### Transportation Costs
- Purchase agreements specify shipping terms to determine while title of the goods transfers to purchaser and who pays the freight
	- **FOB shipping point** means the buyer takes ownership to the goods after the goods leave the sellers place of business
		- The buyer usually pays the freight
	- **FOB Destination** means the buyer takes ownership to the goods at the delivery destination point
		- Seller pays for the freight (typically)
- Merchandisers are required to pay for shipping when:
	- **Freight In** the transportation cost to ship goods into the purchasers warehouse- freight on purchased goods
	- **Freight out** the transportation cost to ship goods out the sellers warehouse and to the customer-thus it is freight on goods sold to a customer
- #### Freight in
