### 1. Foundational Economic Concepts
- #### Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
  * A **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)** is a curve that illustrates the maximum achievable combinations of two goods that can be produced given available resources and technology.
  * **Points on the PPF** are attainable and efficient.
  * **Points below the PPF** are inefficient.
  * **Points above the PPF** are unattainable with current resources.
  * **Economic Growth** is represented by an outward shift of the PPF, allowing the economy to increase its production of goods and services.
- #### Opportunity Cost
  * **Opportunity Cost** is the highest-valued alternative that must be sacrificed to engage in an activity.
  * On a PPF, the opportunity cost is shown by the trade-off between producing more of one good and less of the other.
  * A **straight-line PPF** indicates a **constant** opportunity cost.
  * A **bowed-out (concave) PPF** indicates **increasing marginal opportunity costs**. This occurs because resources are not equally suited to producing all goods.
- #### Comparative Advantage and Trade
  * **Absolute Advantage:** The ability to produce more of a good than a competitor using the same amount of resources.
  * **Comparative Advantage:** The ability to produce a good at a **lower opportunity cost** than a competitor.
  * **Gains from Trade:** The basis for trade is comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. When individuals or countries specialize in producing the good for which they have a comparative advantage and then trade, they can both consume more than they could without trade.

- ### 2. Economic Efficiency and Market Interventions
- #### Consumer and Producer Surplus
  * **Consumer Surplus (CS):** The difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual market price. It is the area below the demand curve and above the price.
  * **Producer Surplus (PS):** The difference between the market price and the lowest price a producer would be willing to accept. It is the area above the supply curve and below the price.
  * **Economic Surplus (Total Surplus):** The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.
  * **Deadweight Loss (DWL):** The reduction in total surplus that results from a market inefficiency, such as price controls or taxes.
- #### Price Regulations
  * **Price Ceiling:** A legal maximum price for a good. If set below the equilibrium price, it creates a **shortage**. This transfers some surplus from producers to consumers but also creates a deadweight loss.
  * **Price Floor:** A legal minimum price for a good. If set above the equilibrium price, it creates a **surplus**. This transfers some surplus from consumers to producers but also creates a deadweight loss.
- #### International Trade
  * **Autarky:** A situation where a country does not trade with other countries. All domestic consumption must be met by domestic production.
  * **Free Trade:** Trade between countries without government restrictions.
  * **Imports (with World Price < Domestic Price):**
    * The domestic price falls to the world price.
    * Consumer surplus increases.
    * Domestic producer surplus decreases.
    * Total economic surplus increases.
  * **Tariff:** A tax imposed by a government on imports.
    * **Effects:** A tariff raises the domestic price, which reduces consumer surplus, increases producer surplus, and creates government tax revenue. It also causes a deadweight loss.
  * **Quota:** A numerical limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported.
    * **Effects:** A quota raises the domestic price, which reduces consumer surplus and increases domestic producer surplus. The surplus gained by foreign producers (Area B in the slide) is a key difference from a tariff. It does **not** create tax revenue for the government and causes a deadweight loss.

- ### 3. Elasticity
  
  * **Elasticity:** A measure of how sensitive one variable is to a change in another.
- #### Price Elasticity of Demand (E_D)
  * Measures how much quantity demanded changes in response to a price change.
  * **Categories:**
    * **Elastic:** $E_D > 1$
    * **Inelastic:** $E_D < 1$
    * **Unit Elastic:** $E_D = 1$
    * **Perfectly Inelastic:** $E_D = 0$ (Vertical demand curve)
    * **Perfectly Elastic:** (Horizontal demand curve)
  * **Elasticity and Total Revenue (TR):**
    * If demand is **inelastic**, an increase in price will **increase** total revenue.
    * If demand is **elastic**, an increase in price will **decrease** total revenue.
- #### Other Elasticities
  * **Cross-Price Elasticity:** Measures how the quantity demanded of one good changes when the price of another good changes.
    * **Positive:** The goods are **substitutes**.
    * **Negative:** The goods are **complements**.
    * **Zero:** The goods are **unrelated** or independent.
  * **Income Elasticity:** Measures how the quantity demanded of a good changes in response to a change in income.
    * **Negative:** **Inferior good** (demand falls as income rises).
    * **Positive:** **Normal good** (demand rises as income rises).
        * **> 1:** Normal and a **Luxury**.
        * **< 1 (and > 0):** Normal and a **Necessity**.

- ### 4. Consumer Choice Theory
  
  * **The Buyer's Problem:** Consumers must make choices about what to buy because they have unlimited desires but limited resources.
  * **Analysis Components:**
    1.  **Preferences** (What you like)
    2.  **Budget Constraint** (What you can afford)
    3.  **Decision** (The optimal choice)
  * **Budget Constraint:** Shows all the combinations of goods a consumer can buy with their income, assuming fixed prices and no saving.
    * An **increase in income** shifts the constraint outward.
    * A **change in one good's price** pivots the constraint.
  * **Consumer Equilibrium:** To maximize benefits, a consumer should spend their money so that the **marginal benefit (MB) per dollar spent** is equal for all goods.
    * Equation: $\frac{MB_{good A}}{Price_{good A}} = \frac{MB_{good B}}{Price_{good B}}$

- ### 5. Production and Costs
  
  * **Short Run vs. Long Run:**
    * **Short Run:** A period where at least one of the firm's inputs is fixed.
    * **Long Run:** A period where a firm can vary all of its inputs.
  * **Types of Costs:**
    * **Explicit Cost:** A cost that involves spending money.
    * **Implicit Cost:** A nonmonetary opportunity cost, such as a forgone salary.
    * **Fixed Costs (FC):** Costs that remain constant as output changes.
    * **Variable Costs (VC):** Costs that change as output changes.
    * **Total Cost (TC):** $TC = FC + VC$.
  * **Marginal Product (MP):** The additional output produced from adding one more unit of an input.
  * **Law of DiminSshing Returns:** In the short run (where capital is fixed), at some point, adding more of a variable input (like labor) will cause the marginal product to decrease.
  * **Average and Marginal Costs:**
    * **Average Total Cost (ATC):** $\frac{TC}{Q}$. The ATC curve is U-shaped.
    * **Average Variable Cost (AVC):** $\frac{VC}{Q}$.
    * **Average Fixed Cost (AFC):** $\frac{FC}{Q}$.
    * **Marginal Cost (MC):** The change in total cost from producing one more unit.

- ### 6. Market Structures
  
  Market structures are defined by the **number of firms** and the **degree of product differentiation**.
  
  | Market Structure | Number of Firms | Type of Product | Barriers to Entry | Price-Taker or Price-Maker? |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Perfect Competition** | Many | Identical (Homogeneous) | None | Price-Taker |
  | **Monopolistic Competition** | Many | Differentiated | None | Price-Maker |
  | **Oligopoly** | A few | Identical or Differentiated | Yes | Price-Maker |
  | **Monopoly** | One | Unique / Undifferentiated | Yes; High | Price-Maker |

- ### 7. Details on Each Market Structure
- #### Perfect Competition
  * **Attributes:** Many firms, homogeneous product, free entry and exit.
  * **Firm's Demand:** A perfectly competitive firm is a **price-taker**. Its demand curve is **perfectly elastic (horizontal)** at the market price.
  * **Revenue:** Because the price is constant, **Price = Marginal Revenue (MR)**.
- #### Monopoly
  * **Attributes:** One seller of a good with no close substitutes.
  * **Barriers to Entry:** High barriers to entry prevent competitors from entering the market.
  * **Firm's Demand:** The monopolist faces the entire **downward-sloping** market demand curve. It is a **price-maker**.
- #### Monopolistic Competition
  * **Attributes:** Many firms and free entry/exit, but firms sell **differentiated products**.
  * **Examples:** Restaurants, books, clothing.
  * **Price:** Firms are price-makers due to product differentiation but face competition.
- #### Oligopoly and Game Theory
  * **Attributes:** Only a few firms compete. Products can be homogeneous (e.g., oil) or differentiated (e.g., cars).
  * **Key Feature:** A high degree of **interdependence**. Each firm's decisions heavily depend on the actions of the other firms.
  * **Game Theory:** The study of these strategic interactions.
    * **Elements:** A game consists of players, strategies, and payoffs.
    * **Payoff Matrix:** Represents the payoffs for each player for all possible strategy combinations.
    * **Dominant Strategy:** A player's best response, regardless of what the other player does.
    * **Prisoners' Dilemma:** A game where both players have a dominant strategy that leads to a worse outcome than if they could cooperate. For example, both prisoners confessing when both holding out would have been better.
    * **Nash Equilibrium:** A situation where each player chooses their best possible strategy, **given the strategies chosen by the other players**. At a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. A game can have one, multiple, or no Nash equilibria.
