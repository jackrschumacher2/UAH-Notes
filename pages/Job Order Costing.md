# Usage of Manufacturing Companies Use Job Order and Process Costing system?
	- Cost accounting systems measure, record, and report product costs
	- Knowing unit costs helps managers
		- Determine which products to produce
		- Set sales prices that will lead to profits
		- Determine how many products to produce
		- Compute cost of goods sold for the income statement
		- Compute the cost of inventory for the balance sheet
	- Job costing system is an accounting system that accumulates costs by job
		- Job is the production of a unique product or specialized service- one unit or a batch of units
	- Process costing system is an accounting system that accumulates costs by process
		- Used when companies manufacture identical units

- # How do Materials and Labor costs flow through the Job Order costing system?
	- Companies use a job cost record to document the product costs for each job

- ## Materials
	- Purchasing materials
		- Often stored for later usage
	- Using direct materials in production
		- Direct Materials
		- Indirect Materials
	- Materials purchased and materials used in production are usually different amounts
- ### Purchasing Materials

- ### Using Materials
	- A materials requisition requests to transfer materials to the production floor
		- **Debit- Work in Process inventory or Manufacturing Overhead**
		- **Credit- Raw Materials inventory**
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1762794067100_0.png){:height 332, :width 544}
	- When materials are received on the production floor, direct materials are recorded on the job cost record

- ## Labor
	- Most companies use electronic labor/time to track labor costs
	- If a manual system is used, each employee completes a labor time record to track and assign direct labor and cost

- # How do overhead costs flow through the Job Order Costing system?
	- Actual Overhead Costs Incurred- In addition to indirect materials and indirect labor, other overhead costs are incurred
		- Depreciation on manufacturing plant and equipment of $20,000
			- **Debit-Depreciation expense**
			- **Credit-Accumulated Depreciation**
		- Plant utilities $7,000
		- Plant insurance of $6,000
		- Plant property taxes incurred by not yet paid of $5,000

	-
	- Actual manufacturing **overhead costs are not known until the end of the period**
	- Managers use a **predetermined overhead allocation** rate to allocate costs to jobs before the end of the period
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1762794651705_0.png){:height 156, :width 521}
	- An allocation base links overhead costs to jobs
	- Primary cost driver causes an increases or a decrease in the cost
	- Common manufacturing company cost drivers are:
		- Direct labor hours (labor intensive production enviroment)
		- Direct labor cost (for labor intensive production enviroment)
		- Machine hours (for machine intensive production environment)

- ## What happens when products are completed and sold?
	- After accumulating, assigning, and allocating the costs of direct materials, direct labor, and overhead jobs, a company
		- Accounting for completion of jobs
		- Accounts for the sale of jobs
		- Adjusts Manufacturing Overhead at the end of the period

- ## How is Manufacturing overhead account adjusted?
	- Companies must adjust the Manufacturing Overhead account for any over or under allocation of overhead
		- Underallocated overhead occurs when actual manufacturing overhead costs are more than allocated manufacturing overhead costs
		- Overallocated overhead costs occur when the actual manufacturing overhead costs are less than allocated manufacturing overhead costs

- ### Data analytics in Accounting
	- For manufacturing companies, knowing the cost of production is vital to their sucess
		- Managers can use the job order costing system to accumulate large quantities of data
		- Data can be used in decision making
- # How do Service companies use a Job order costing system?
	- Service companies do not have inventory or manufacturing costs
	- Trace direct labor to jobs
	- Allocate overhead costs to jobs
		- Computing predetermined overhead allocation rate
		- Allocating indirect costs to jobs, using predetermined overhead allocation rate
	- Use the costing info to make pricing decisions
