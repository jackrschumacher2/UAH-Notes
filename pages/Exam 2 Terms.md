# ECN143: Principles of Microeconomics - Key Definitions
- ### 📈 Foundational Economic Concepts
- **Law of Demand:** Consumers buy more of a good when its price is lower, holding other factors constant.
  * **Substitutes:** Goods used in place of another.
  * **Complements:** Goods consumed together.
  * **Market Equilibrium:** Occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, establishing the equilibrium price and quantity.
  * **Surplus (Excess Supply):** Occurs when quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded.
  * **Shortage (Excess Demand):** Occurs when quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied.
  * **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF):** A curve showing the maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced with available resources and technology.
  * **Opportunity Cost:** The highest-valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an activity.
  * **Absolute Advantage:** The ability to produce more of a good than a competitor using the same amount of resources.
  * **Comparative Advantage:** The ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than a competitor.
  * **Consumer Surplus:** The difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual market price they do pay.
  * **Producer Surplus:** The difference between the market price and the lowest price a producer would be willing to accept for a good.
  * **Deadweight Loss (DWL):** The reduction in total (consumer + producer) surplus that occurs as a result of a market inefficiency.

- ### 🏛️ Government Intervention and Trade
- **Price Ceiling:** A legally set maximum price for a good or service.
  * **Price Floor:** A legally set minimum price for a good or service.
  * **Surplus Transfer:** Regulations that move surplus from one group to another.
  * **Autarky:** A state of no international trade.
  * **Free Trade:** Trade without government restrictions.
  * **Tariff:** A tax imposed by a government on imported goods.
  * **Quota:** A numerical limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported.

- ### 🧑‍💼 Consumer and Producer Behavior
- **Budget Constraint:** Defines what combinations of goods a consumer can afford given their income and the (fixed) prices of goods.
  * **Elasticity:** Measures how sensitive one variable is to changes in another.
  * **Price Elasticity of Demand (E_D):** Measures how much quantity demanded responds to a change in price.
    * **Elastic (Demand):** $E_D > 1$.
    * **Inelastic (Demand):** $E_D < 1$.
    * **Unit Elastic (Demand):** $E_D = 1$.
  * **Cross-Price Elasticity:** Measures how the demand for one good changes when the price of another good changes.
  * **Income Elasticity:** Measures how demand changes in response to a change in consumer income.
    * **Normal Good:** Demand increases as income increases.
    * **Inferior Good:** Demand decreases as income increases.
  * **Technology:** The processes a firm uses to turn inputs into outputs (goods and services).
  * **Short Run:** A period where at least one of the firm's inputs is fixed.
  * **Long Run:** A period long enough for the firm to vary all of its inputs.
  * **Marginal Product:** The additional output produced by adding one more unit of an input.
  * **Law of Diminishing Returns:** In the short run, as a firm adds more of a variable input to a fixed input, the marginal product will eventually decrease.
  * **Explicit Costs:** Costs that involve a direct monetary payment.
  * **Implicit Costs:** Nonmonetary opportunity costs.
  * **Fixed Costs (FC):** Costs that do not change as output changes.
  * **Variable Costs (VC):** Costs that change as output changes.
  * **Total Cost (TC):** $TC = FC + VC$.
  * **Marginal Cost (MC):** The change in total cost from producing one more unit of output.
  * **Marginal Revenue (MR):** The extra revenue from selling one more unit.

- ### 🧩 Game Theory and Market Structures
- **Game Theory:** The study of strategic interactions.
- **Backward Induction:** The procedure of solving an extensive form game by considering the last mover's decision
- **Simultaneous Move Game:** A game where players select their strategies at the same time without knowing the other's choice.
  * **Payoff Matrix:** Shows the payoffs (outcomes) for each player for each strategy.
  * **Dominant Strategy:** A player's best response, regardless of what the other player does.
  * **Dominant Strategy Equilibrium:** An outcome where each player uses their dominant strategy.
  * **Nash Equilibrium:** A situation where each player chooses a strategy that is best for them, given the strategies chosen by the other players.
  * **Perfect Competition:** An industry structure with many firms, a homogeneous product, free entry and exit, and complete information.
  * **Price Taker:** A firm in a perfectly competitive market that has no influence over the market price.
- **Nodes:** The decision points in an extensive form games
- **The Tragedy of the Commons:** The overuse of shared resources that results in a negative externality
- **Monopoly:** A market structure with one firm, a unique product, and high barriers to entry.
  * **Market Power:** The ability to set the price.
  * **Oligopoly:** A market structure with a few competing firms, significant barriers to entry, and interdependent decision-making.
  * **Homogeneous (Products):** Identical products.
  * **Differentiated (Products):** Products that are similar but not identical.
  * **Monopolistic Competition:** A market structure with many firms, differentiated products, and no barriers to entry.
