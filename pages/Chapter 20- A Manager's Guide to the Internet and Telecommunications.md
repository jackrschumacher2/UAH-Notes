- # Internet 101: Understanding How the Internet Works
	- The internet is a network of networks
		- Your local network (intranet) connects to the Internet service provider to access the wider internet
		- There is no center to the internet, no one owns it
			- Therefore is extremely fault tolerant
			- Arose from military and education institutions work as far back as the 1960s
				- Took off in the 1990s when graphical browsing was invented
				- Architecture was then transitioned to private firms rather than government grants

	- ## The URL: “What Are You Looking For?”
		- **URL (uniform resource locator)** - Used interchangeably with "Web Address", URLs are used to identify resources on the Internet along with the application protocol needed to retrieve it
			- Basically used to tell your browser what you are looking for
		- #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		  The URL displayed really says, “Use the Web’s secure SSL protocol (https://) to find a host server named ‘www’ in the ‘nytimes.com’ network, look in the ‘tech’ directory, and access the ‘index.html’ file.”

		- **Hypertext transfer protocol** - Application transfer protocol that allows web browsers and Web servers to communicate with each other
			- Most sites now use https instead of http
				- Shift occurred aggressively several years ago
				- Warning shows up if not secure
				- https is achieved by using **SSL- Secure Sockets Layer**
					- SSL encrypts web transmissions so they can be securely sent between locations
					- **Does not mean that the transmission is totally secure-only the transmission from end to end is safe**
			- These protocols are designed to be independent from hardware
		- Other network protocols
			- **SMTP** - Simple mail transfer protocol
			- **FTP** - File Transfer protcol
