- ## Gap: An Icon in Crisis
	- Most fashion retailers place orders for a seasonal collection months before in stores
	- **Inventory = Death**
		- Having too much unwanted product on hand and you will be forced to mark down or write off items

			- Was saddled with inventory
	- **Contract Manufacturing** in developing countries can keep the cost of goods low
		- Lower prices and sell more product
		- Race to the bottom in cost cutting measures
		- Increasing accusations of using sweatshop labor
		- Bangladesh has a bad reputation for unsafe worker conditions in factories
		- Tech can be used to identify companies that have unsafe or sub-standard labor practices (Rebook) or dishonest manufacturers
