	- ### Threat Hunting Steps
		- Trigger
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Collect information about the environment and hypothesis
			- **Choose a trigger for further investigation**
			- Can be a system, network area, or hypothesis trigger by a vulnerability or patch or information about an exploit, security set anomalies or requests from other areas in the organization
		- Investigation
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Hunting efforts are focused on proactive searching for anomalies
				- Can prove or disprove the hypothesis
				- Assumption \rarr "We are compromised or vulnerable to this new exploit"
				- Hunters use a wide range of tech to assist them in reviewing logs and investigating anomalies
		- Resolution
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org)
			- Globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real world operations
